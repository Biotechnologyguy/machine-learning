# Machine Learning Specialization - Exercise Notebooks üìí

This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks with exercise solutions from the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng, offered by Stanford Online and DeepLearning.AI. The specialization provided a deep dive into foundational machine learning concepts, leveraging libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn, and covering a wide range of algorithms and techniques.

## What I've Learned üìù

- Building and training machine learning models in Python.
- Applying both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
- Practical uses of algorithms like linear and logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, and more.
- Techniques for preventing overfitting, such as regularization.
- Working with TensorFlow and frameworks for complex models like XGBoost.
- Insights into model development, anomaly detection, collaborative filtering, and reinforcement learning.

## Course Structure ‚úçüèª

1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
   - Focusing on prediction and binary classification tasks.
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
   - Diving into complex algorithms and their applications.
3. **Unsupervised Learning and Recommender Systems**
   - Exploring clustering, dimensionality reduction, and recommender systems.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the notebooks, run the code, and use the exercises to deepen your own understanding of machine learning concepts.
```bash
